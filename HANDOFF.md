# HANDOFF — read this first

State of the DLSS-NR on Intel Xe2 project as of **2026-09-09**. CLAUDE.md holds the
original brief; **this file overrides it wherever they disagree**, and after
2026-09-09 they disagree about something foundational.

---

## 0. The one thing to know

**The weight container does not hold plain dense FP16, and almost every dead end in
this project traces to assuming it does.**

`iamwavecut/MLX-DLSS` ships working extraction code for the same DLL. Run on ours it
turns the 153 packed tensors into **649 named, shaped, logical tensors** — none
unsupported, none opaque. The payload is packed into `mma` fragment order and partly
E4M3; our reader was interpreting those bytes as dense FP16.

Proof it matters: `block0.layer0.input_adapter_weight` is `(16, 32)`, exactly the
512-element region we had located at the front of block0. Its logical values have
**correlation −0.02** with our raw FP16 read of the same bytes, and sd **0.2489**
against our 0.0306 — the `1/sqrt(16) = 0.25` that `notes/phase5-stem.md` predicted a
16-input projection should have. Right location, right shape, wrong decode.

So: **start from `work/mlxw/dlssnr-logical.safetensors`, not from
`src/tools/hnet_weights.py`.** Everything we derived from the *kernels* survives;
everything we derived from container *bytes* has to be re-checked against the logical
tensors.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/iamwavecut/MLX-DLSS work/mlx-dlss
T=work/mlx-dlss/python/mlxdlss/tools
PYTHONPATH=work/shim python3 $T/extract_dlssnr_weights.py work/dl/nvngx_dlssnr.dll work/mlxw/dlssnr-packed.safetensors
PYTHONPATH=work/shim python3 $T/unpack_dlssnr_weights.py work/mlxw/dlssnr-packed.safetensors work/mlxw/dlssnr-logical.safetensors
```

`work/shim/safetensors/` is a 60-line format-compatible shim — this machine has no pip
and the real package needs sudo. Round-trip verified. Both files already exist.

---

## 1. Do this first

1. **Rewrite `src/ref/hnet_model.py` to load the logical safetensors.** 27 tensor roles,
   649 tensors, all named. The block layout guesswork it currently does — gate
   anchoring, `qkv_n = 1.5C²`, surplus carving for the stem/head/resample — is all
   obsolete.
2. **Re-run the layer checks** in `src/ref/hnet_ops.py` and `src/gpu/test_attention_gpu.py`
   against the logical weights. The kernel-derived operators should now have correct
   inputs for the first time.
3. Only then go back to `src/ref/run_frame.py`.

---

## 2. What is solid — measured from the kernels, unaffected by the packing

| Fact | Where |
|---|---|
| Attention **is** softmax: logits hard-clamped (Swin ±6, ViT ±3), `exp` hand-rolled in f16x2 bit arithmetic, **no max subtraction**. Constants exact, verified bit-exact | `notes/phase5-softmax-found.md` |
| The gate multiplies the **skip**, fused into the `mma` C operand: `D = A·B + gate⊙x`; the branch is added unscaled | `notes/phase5-gate-on-skip.md` |
| `attn_scale` is **FP32 per head** (`ld.global.b32` + `cvt.rn.f16.f32`, stride 4, indexed `head = 4·ctaid.z + tid.y`) | `notes/phase5-attn-scale-fp32.md` |
| **head_dim = 32 at every width**, from the QK-norm reduction (4 lanes × 4 squares × 2). Head count = C/32 | `notes/phase5-narrow-blocks.md` |
| Kernel parameter block: `+0` input, `+8` output, `+16` weight arena, `+24/+32` dims. I/O kernels take descriptor tables | `notes/phase5-io-structs.md` |
| **Input is five optional 2D textures**, `tex.2d.v4.f32`; only colour is required | `notes/phase5-input-contract.md` |
| **16-channel packing order**: ch4-6 colour, ch7-9 reprojected history (same affine `(x−a)·b`), ch12-14 sign-encoded validity. MLX-DLSS agrees independently | `notes/phase5-channel-order.md` |
| Output head is **32 → 4**; three channels become display RGB | `notes/phase5-output-head.md` |
| XMX flushes subnormal FP16 to zero; fixed by a per-tensor 2^k rescale | `notes/phase4-subnormal-flush.md` |
| CPU and XMX agree to 9.7e-07 over 4.2M elements | `notes/phase4-end-to-end.md` |

## 3. Withdrawn — do not resurrect

Today alone: **eight**. This is the normal rate here; assume the next confident claim is
also wrong until it survives an adversarial test.

- **"The weights are plain FP16, used exactly as stored."** Section 0.
- **"GQA 4:1, Q=C², K=V=C²/4."** `qkv_weight` is `(C, 3C)` — **full MHA, no GQA**. The
  narrow-block Q/K/V split that resisted three methods does not exist.
- **"DLSS-NR does not use softmax."** The `ex2` census was right, the inference wrong;
  `ptx_trace.py` was dropping every `{ … }` scope, which is where the f16x2 exp lives.
- **"3C² means K and V are pre-replicated."** The factor 2 is uniform across all
  matrices — it is the packing, not GQA.
- **"The 128C region is an attention mask."** `max = 0.00` was a rounded print; the
  fraction of exact zeros is 0.0000.
- **"`attn_scale` is stored as a log."** Right symptom, wrong mechanism — it is FP32.
- **"The attention branch helps, 1.39x swing."** Reverses on a structurally different
  image and on two real Cyberpunk frames, where the branch **costs 1.37x**. The swing
  was the branch repairing damage the bilinear scaffolding does to `test_pattern`'s
  fixed-period lines. `notes/phase5-input-dependence.md`
- **"1.02x better than the input."** True only at sigma 0.06 on one synthetic pattern.
  Swept: the network adds a fixed distortion of 0.0163 and removes a constant 6.5 % of
  noise — constancy being the signature of a linear filter, not a denoiser.

Older, still withdrawn: the "missing 2^8.5 factor", the "~450x branch/skip factor" (it
followed from the wrong gate form), the leading-region projection, and "1.01x parity"
(a pass-through).

---

## 4. Traps this project keeps falling into

- **Tools that skip input silently.** `ptx_trace.py` dropped brace scopes and hid 120k
  instructions. Always check coverage: parsed statements vs `;` count, and whether the
  dataflow graph is connected.
- **PTX is not SSA, and it has loops.** "Last definition before the use" is only valid
  in straight-line code. The pre-block's store tail sits *textually before* the texture
  reads it consumes, because it is a loop body. A def/use map over all definitions
  invents edges; program order alone is not enough either.
- **The metric has had five holes.** Correlation rewards inaction; dividing by a fitted
  gain is 0/0 on collapse; a pass-through scores 1.00x; the score measured the
  scaffolding not the model for a whole phase; and results depended on the test image
  and the noise level. `run_frame.py` now reports COLLAPSED, PASS-THROUGH and
  NETWORK-INERT — **and `--no-attend` is the control to run whenever a score moves.**
- **Statistical segmentation cannot find tensor boundaries.** Three methods failed
  calibration at C=512 where the answer was known. The notes said so; I re-ran one of
  them anyway. Read section 3 before trying a fourth.
- **External write-ups are summaries, not sources.** A WebFetch of `weight_spec.json`
  returned plausible-looking shapes with a confabulated label (`block31` as "final
  output stage"). Clone the repo and read the file.

## 5. Layout, commands, repo

```
ref/        the DLL (0444) + sha256      NEVER modify, NEVER commit
work/       weights, PTX modules, mlx-dlss clone, mlxw/*.safetensors, shim, builds
notes/      23 findings documents
src/tools/  PE/resource readers, the weight reader (now superseded), model_spec,
            and the PTX analysis tools: ptx_trace (dataflow), ptx_addrform

Git repo initialised 2026-09-08, three commits, **code only** — `.gitignore` keeps the
DLL, the weights, the driver payload and the game screenshots out. `/ultrareview` is
ready to run (user-triggered; the model cannot launch it).

Regression, all should exit 0:

Frame harness flags: `--seed N --sigma S --smooth <path>` (a supplied image is the
clean reference and noise is added to it), `--no-attend`, `--slice-head`, `--stem`,
`--resample`, `--gate-gated-branch`, `--true-softmax`, `--scale-f16`, `--trace`.

## 6. Honest standing

The reconstruction runs end to end on NVIDIA's weights and agrees between CPU and XMX,
but **there is no demonstrated denoising**: on real frames the scaffolding alone beats
the input 1.37x–1.99x and switching the network's attention on makes it *worse*. The
end-to-end score currently measures the quality of a bilinear stand-in, not the model.

That is expected to change, because the reason is now known: every operator was being
fed weights decoded under the wrong assumption. Start at section 1.

## 7. Hardware (probed, trust it)

Intel Arc 140V-class Xe2, Mesa ANV, Vulkan 1.4.354, subgroup 32. Six cooperative-matrix
configs, all scope=subgroup, all M=8 N=16; the path is **fp16 × fp16 → fp32** (config 1).
`cooperativeMatrixRobustBufferAccess = false`, so edge tiles need explicit padding.
Shared-memory APU: correctness and capacity are unaffected (141 MiB of weights against
an 11.46 GiB heap); it caps **bandwidth**, already the measured ceiling at 0.7–1.9
TFLOP/s with a naive kernel. `libxmx.c` still memcpys into a mapped HOST_VISIBLE buffer
on every dispatch — on an integrated GPU those copies are free to remove.
