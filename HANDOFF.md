# HANDOFF — read this first

State of the DLSS-NR on Intel Xe2 project as of **2026-09-09**. CLAUDE.md holds the
original brief; **this file overrides it wherever they disagree**, and after
2026-09-09 they disagree about something foundational.

## IT RENDERS (2026-09-09, later)

A frame goes in and a neurally-rendered frame comes out, with the real effect:
eyelashes and eyebrow hairs resolved out of a smeared input, skin pores synthesised,
iris and eyeliner sharpened. `notes/phase7-first-render.md`.

```
python3 src/ref/nr_frame.py IN.png OUT.png --resident        # 0.26 s — the fast path
python3 src/ref/nr_temporal.py IN.png OUT --resident --pan 6,0 --frames 5
work/venv/bin/python src/ref/nr_frame.py IN.png OUT.png --accel   # 10 s, best on CPU
python3 src/ref/nr_frame.py IN.png OUT.png                   # 38 s, netlib reference
```

A full **1280x720** frame renders too, network extent 1280x768, no tiling artefacts.

- `src/ref/nr_model.py` — the recovered 71-block graph in numpy (a port of MLX-DLSS's
  PyTorch `model.py`, Apache-2.0; no torch on this machine). One GEMM entry point,
  `nr_model.MATMUL`, for the XMX swap.
- `src/ref/nr_frame.py` — frame in / frame out, using MLX-DLSS's pure-numpy
  `features.py` and `composition.py` loaded by path from `work/mlx-dlss`.
- Our 649 logical tensors match their `weight_spec.json` **exactly** — 0 missing,
  0 extra, 0 shape mismatches. Two independent extractions of the same DLL agree.
- Two controls passed. Shuffled weights give a flat red tint with no pores and no
  lashes (structure-blind, ratio 0.98 vs the trained 1.18). The recovered control
  profiles work: `neutral` switches the network off by **37x** (change 0.00071 vs
  0.02610), and `natural` / `cinematic` are distinct styles.
- **`src/ref/{hnet_model,hnet_ops,hnet_ref,forward,run_frame}.py` are superseded.**
  They decode the packed container as dense FP16 and guess the block layout. Keep them
  for the PTX-derived findings they encode; do not build on them.
- **Phase 4 is done**: `src/gpu/nr_xmx.py` puts every GEMM on the XMX units, the
  batched attention included. `notes/phase8-xmx-graph.md`.
- **`src/gpu/nr_xmx.py` (the GEMM-hook path) is superseded by residency** and kept
  only for comparison. It lost to a good CPU BLAS, because a dispatch round-trips its
  activation through host memory; that is what made residency the precondition rather
  than an optimisation. The CPU baselines are worth remembering: the system numpy is
  netlib reference at ~3 GFLOP/s, a pip numpy is OpenBLAS at 214, and on the 384 face
  netlib CPU is 38.0 s against OpenBLAS CPU 17.5 s. `notes/phase13-torch-and-blas.md`.
- **The numpy port is bit-identical to MLX-DLSS's PyTorch original** — every primitive,
  every layout operator, all four block families on real weights, and the whole
  71-block forward, once the same GEMM is given to both.
  `python3 src/ref/test_against_torch.py` under `work/venv`.
- **Per-element agreement is not a property a port can have.** Each precision regime
  annihilates perturbations below its own working precision *exactly* and jumps
  straight to 9-12 % of the head's sd above it — float32 flips between 1e-09 and
  1e-07, half between 1e-05 and 1e-03. numpy's own float32 GEMM carries 5.2e-07 of
  error, above the float32 threshold, so **any** correct float32 implementation would
  diverge from this reference by the whole floor. Judge on the composed image and on
  the controls, never per-element. `notes/phase9-numerics.md`.

---

- **The NPU is not worth using.** Present and driver-ready (`/dev/accel/accel0`,
  `intel_vpu`), but the GPU is the faster engine in this SoC (67 TOPS against 48), our
  own shader runs at 4 % of it, all three engines share one memory pool so the actual
  bottleneck does not move, and the graph's bit-level ops do not fit an NPU compiler's
  operator set. `notes/phase14-npu-and-rounding.md`.

---

## 0. The one thing to know

**The weight container does not hold plain dense FP16, and almost every dead end in
this project traces to assuming it does.**

`iamwavecut/MLX-DLSS` ships working extraction code for the same DLL. Run on ours it
turns the 153 packed tensors into **649 named, shaped, logical tensors** — none
unsupported, none opaque. The payload is packed into `mma` fragment order and partly
E4M3; our reader was interpreting those bytes as dense FP16.

Proof it matters: `block0.layer0.input_adapter_weight` is `(16, 32)`, exactly the
512-element region we had located at the front of block0. Its logical values have
**correlation −0.02** with our raw FP16 read of the same bytes, and sd **0.2489**
against our 0.0306 — the `1/sqrt(16) = 0.25` that `notes/phase5-stem.md` predicted a
16-input projection should have. Right location, right shape, wrong decode.

So: **start from `work/mlxw/dlssnr-logical.safetensors`, not from
`src/tools/hnet_weights.py`.** Everything we derived from the *kernels* survives;
everything we derived from container *bytes* has to be re-checked against the logical
tensors.

```

`work/shim/safetensors/` is a 60-line format-compatible shim — this machine has no pip
and the real package needs sudo. Round-trip verified. Both files already exist.

## 1. Do this first

**Done 2026-09-09.** The graph runs, on CPU and on XMX. What is left, in order of
value:

1. **The GEMM kernel, which is where the remaining performance is.** It measures
   2584 GFLOP/s, **8.1 %** of this GPU's FP16 peak, because the shader has no
   shared-memory staging, no K-blocking and no register reuse — every workgroup
   re-reads both operands for one 8x16 tile. Of a 1025 ms 720p frame only ~300 ms is
   genuinely bounded (177 arithmetic, 110-145 traffic); the other **~700 ms is
   dispatch overhead and occupancy** on the graph's many small shapes. A
   well-optimised version plausibly reaches 100-200 ms, and 30 fps needs about a
   640x384 extent. Second lever: activations as half rather than float32, which is
   what the vendor's own kernels do and would halve the traffic.
   *(Blocked, and worth knowing: folding the elementwise work into the GEMM epilogue
   would be the bigger win, but any operation on the accumulator between
   `coopMatMulAdd` and `coopMatStore` scrambles the result on Mesa 26.2.1 / ANV. See
   `notes/phase18-fusion.md` — worth reporting upstream.)*
2. **A real game, not `vkcube`.** The photo-mode loop is proven on a toy; the next
   step is a title under Proton. DX12 goes DX12 -> VKD3D -> Vulkan on ANV, DX11 and
   DX9 through DXVK, so the layer should attach unchanged. `src/layer/nr-photo --steam`
   prints the launch option.
3. ~~**The temporal path**~~ **DONE 2026-09-09** — `src/ref/nr_temporal.py`,
   `notes/phase12-temporal.md`. The history gate is the head's fourth channel, and it
   works: alpha goes 0.008 with no history -> **0.705** with correctly reprojected
   history (ceiling 0.7397) -> **0.032** when the motion is wrong. Flicker on a static
   scene falls 3.6x by frame 3 and 6.3x at the peak, with no high-frequency loss.
   Optical-flow motion and processing_scale != 1 still need OpenCV/Pillow, which this
   machine lacks; engine motion works.
4. ~~**The DX12/Proton integration**~~ — the door turned out to be a Vulkan layer
   rather than an NGX hook; see item 2.

Smaller, if wanted: `MIN_MACS` in `nr_xmx.py` was tuned against the reference BLAS
and should be re-swept; `split_group_feed_forward` still issues `2*groups` GEMMs and
could fold the same way the branched one now does.

---

## 2. What is solid — measured from the kernels, unaffected by the packing

| Fact | Where |
|---|---|
| Attention **is** softmax: logits hard-clamped (Swin ±6, ViT ±3), `exp` hand-rolled in f16x2 bit arithmetic, **no max subtraction**. Constants exact, verified bit-exact | `notes/phase5-softmax-found.md` |
| The gate multiplies the **skip**, fused into the `mma` C operand: `D = A·B + gate⊙x`; the branch is added unscaled | `notes/phase5-gate-on-skip.md` |
| `attn_scale` is **FP32 per head** (`ld.global.b32` + `cvt.rn.f16.f32`, stride 4, indexed `head = 4·ctaid.z + tid.y`) | `notes/phase5-attn-scale-fp32.md` |
| **head_dim = 32 at every width**, from the QK-norm reduction (4 lanes × 4 squares × 2). Head count = C/32 | `notes/phase5-narrow-blocks.md` |
| Kernel parameter block: `+0` input, `+8` output, `+16` weight arena, `+24/+32` dims. I/O kernels take descriptor tables | `notes/phase5-io-structs.md` |
| **Input is five optional 2D textures**, `tex.2d.v4.f32`; only colour is required | `notes/phase5-input-contract.md` |
| **16-channel packing order**: ch4-6 colour, ch7-9 reprojected history (same affine `(x−a)·b`), ch12-14 sign-encoded validity. MLX-DLSS agrees independently | `notes/phase5-channel-order.md` |
| Output head is **32 → 4**; three channels become display RGB | `notes/phase5-output-head.md` |
| XMX flushes subnormal FP16 to zero; fixed by a per-tensor 2^k rescale | `notes/phase4-subnormal-flush.md` |
| **Each precision regime has a sharp threshold**: below it a perturbation is annihilated exactly, above it the head jumps to 9-12 % of its sd. float32 ~1e-07, half ~1e-04. The half path is the **more stable** of the two | `notes/phase9-numerics.md` |
| The whole CPU/XMX gap is the FP16 rounding of GEMM *activations*, and **97.3 % of them are already half-valued** — only 186 of 6987 calls are touched. Weights change nothing: 579 of 649 tensors are stored F16, the other 70 are `attn_scale`, not a GEMM operand | `notes/phase9-numerics.md` |
| Batched attention and the folded branched FFN are **bit-identical** to the plain GEMM hook; the two 720p renders are pixel-identical | `notes/phase9-numerics.md` |
| ~~CPU and XMX agree to 9.7e-07 over 4.2M elements~~ — measured on a pass-through with no E4M3 publishes in it; does not transfer | `notes/phase4-end-to-end.md` |

## 3. Withdrawn — do not resurrect

Today alone: **eight**. This is the normal rate here; assume the next confident claim is
also wrong until it survives an adversarial test.

- **"The weights are plain FP16, used exactly as stored."** Section 0.
- **"GQA 4:1, Q=C², K=V=C²/4."** `qkv_weight` is `(C, 3C)` — **full MHA, no GQA**. The
  narrow-block Q/K/V split that resisted three methods does not exist.
- **"DLSS-NR does not use softmax."** The `ex2` census was right, the inference wrong;
  `ptx_trace.py` was dropping every `{ … }` scope, which is where the f16x2 exp lives.
- **"3C² means K and V are pre-replicated."** The factor 2 is uniform across all
  matrices — it is the packing, not GQA.
- **"The 128C region is an attention mask."** `max = 0.00` was a rounded print; the
  fraction of exact zeros is 0.0000.
- **"`attn_scale` is stored as a log."** Right symptom, wrong mechanism — it is FP32.
- **"The attention branch helps, 1.39x swing."** Reverses on a structurally different
  image and on two real Cyberpunk frames, where the branch **costs 1.37x**. The swing
  was the branch repairing damage the bilinear scaffolding does to `test_pattern`'s
  fixed-period lines. `notes/phase5-input-dependence.md`
- **"1.02x better than the input."** True only at sigma 0.06 on one synthetic pattern.
  Swept: the network adds a fixed distortion of 0.0163 and removes a constant 6.5 % of
  noise — constancy being the signature of a linear filter, not a denoiser.

Older, still withdrawn: the "missing 2^8.5 factor", the "~450x branch/skip factor" (it
followed from the wrong gate form), the leading-region projection, and "1.01x parity"
(a pass-through).

---

## 4. Traps this project keeps falling into

- **Tools that skip input silently.** `ptx_trace.py` dropped brace scopes and hid 120k
  instructions. Always check coverage: parsed statements vs `;` count, and whether the
  dataflow graph is connected.
- **PTX is not SSA, and it has loops.** "Last definition before the use" is only valid
  in straight-line code. The pre-block's store tail sits *textually before* the texture
  reads it consumes, because it is a loop body. A def/use map over all definitions
  invents edges; program order alone is not enough either.
- **The metric has had five holes.** Correlation rewards inaction; dividing by a fitted
  gain is 0/0 on collapse; a pass-through scores 1.00x; the score measured the
  scaffolding not the model for a whole phase; and results depended on the test image
  and the noise level. `run_frame.py` now reports COLLAPSED, PASS-THROUGH and
  NETWORK-INERT — **and `--no-attend` is the control to run whenever a score moves.**
- **Statistical segmentation cannot find tensor boundaries.** Three methods failed
  calibration at C=512 where the answer was known. The notes said so; I re-ran one of
  them anyway. Read section 3 before trying a fourth.
- **External write-ups are summaries, not sources.** A WebFetch of `weight_spec.json`
  returned plausible-looking shapes with a confabulated label (`block31` as "final
  output stage"). Clone the repo and read the file.

Git repo initialised 2026-09-08, three commits, **code only** — `.gitignore` keeps the
DLL, the weights, the driver payload and the game screenshots out. `/ultrareview` is
ready to run (user-triggered; the model cannot launch it).

Regression, all should exit 0:

```
python3 src/ref/test_nr_model.py                  # primitives, codec, temporal, graph
work/venv/bin/python src/ref/test_against_torch.py # bit-identical to the original

python3 src/ref/nr_frame.py IN.png OUT.png --gpu  # the visual check
python3 src/ref/nr_frame.py IN.png OUT.png --profile neutral   # the control: ~37x smaller
```

`nr_frame.py` flags: `--gpu --size HxW --profile {standard,neutral,natural,cinematic}
--intensity F --detail-strength F --colour-strength F --frame-index N -v`.

**Controls** (`notes/phase10-controls.md`). Free, post-network — one pass covers the
whole range: `--intensity` (exactly linear, 0 an exact no-op, clamped to [0,1]),
`--detail-strength` / `--colour-strength` (the change is 0.0049 high frequency against
0.0249 low, so `--colour-strength 0` is detail with no tonal shift; past
`--detail-strength 2` it over-sharpens), `--intensity-ladder` renders once and writes
one file per value. Costing a pass each: `--style-index` (a different character, corr
0.50 with style 0 at index 1 — but only 0-8 are sane, 64 gives a magenta cast),
`--local-tone` / `--local-structure` (smooth monotone gains, colour-neutral and safe to
over-drive: tone reaches 1.24x at 2.0, structure peaks near 1.5), `--skin-structure`,
`--auto-mask`, `--control-mask`. Model A/B/C is **not** reproducible — the shipped
weights prove only slot 0.

`nr_xmx.install(fuse_branched=True, exact=False)`. `exact=True` carries activations
half cannot hold as a sum of two halves — more accurate than the reference's own
float32 GEMM — for 16.8 s -> 21.2 s. It moves the head gap from 0.0174 to 0.0124 and
no further; see `notes/phase9-numerics.md` for why zero is not reachable.

The old harness (`src/tools/model_spec.py`, `src/ref/hnet_*.py`, `run_frame.py`) still
runs but is built on the wrong weight decode; its scores measure scaffolding.

---

## 6. Honest standing

**The prototype works.** A frame goes in, a neurally-rendered frame comes out, on
NVIDIA's own weights, with the effect the feature is sold on. Two adversarial controls
pass (`notes/phase7-first-render.md`). The previous entry here — "no demonstrated
denoising" — is retired; its cause was the weight decode, exactly as section 0 predicted.

What is *not* claimed:

- **No NVIDIA parity gate.** There is still no NVIDIA GPU here, so there are still no
  reference activations. The graph is MLX-DLSS's recovery from vendor captures, and it
  is validated against their spec and against behaviour, not against the DLL.
- **The whole graph is resident on the GPU**: **0.18 s** at 384x384 and **~1.03 s**
  at 720p after the elementwise fusion, head correlation 0.9918 with the CPU
  reference and a visually indistinguishable picture.
  `src/gpu/nr_frame_resident.py`, `notes/phase15-residency.md`,
  `notes/phase18-fusion.md`.
- **It runs in a game.** A Vulkan layer captures the presented frame, a daemon runs
  the model, and the result goes back into the swapchain — a photo mode, triggered by
  a file. Verified end to end on `vkcube`.
  `src/layer/`, `notes/phase17-integration-landscape.md`, `notes/phase19-photo-mode.md`.
- **HDR is handled**: `src/ref/nr_display.py`, the recovered display codec — encode a
  linear-HDR frame to an sRGB proxy with a soft knee, run the model, fold it back by
  luminance ratio onto the untouched original. Clamping instead destroys 97 % of the
  highlight structure. `notes/phase16-hdr.md`.
- **The machine's real limits, measured** (`notes/phase20-machine-limits.md`):
  **70-91 GB/s** of memory bandwidth against 136.5 theoretical, the GPU holding its
  **1950 MHz ceiling** throughout a run at 46-48 C, and our GEMM at **8.1 %** of the
  ~32 TFLOP/s FP16 peak. Earlier notes quoted 23 GB/s, which was single-threaded
  numpy and wrong by 3x. The slack is in our kernel, not the chip. Every GEMM is on the GPU; the
  remaining 71 % is elementwise numpy, and the round trips cost more than the kernel
  saves.
- **Single frame.** No motion vectors, no history, no temporal path.
- The graph recovery is **not ours**. Ours is the Xe2 execution path, the numpy
  reference, the independent second extraction that confirms their weight spec, and
  the PTX findings in section 2 that their write-up and ours agree on.

## 7. Hardware (probed, trust it)

Intel Arc 140V-class Xe2, Mesa ANV, Vulkan 1.4.354, subgroup 32. Six cooperative-matrix
configs, all scope=subgroup, all M=8 N=16; the path is **fp16 × fp16 → fp32** (config 1).
`cooperativeMatrixRobustBufferAccess = false`, so edge tiles need explicit padding.
Shared-memory APU: correctness and capacity are unaffected (141 MiB of weights against
an 11.46 GiB heap); it caps **bandwidth**, already the measured ceiling at 0.7–1.9
TFLOP/s with a naive kernel. `libxmx.c` still memcpys into a mapped HOST_VISIBLE buffer
on every dispatch — on an integrated GPU those copies are free to remove.
